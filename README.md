## Chapter 1 Objectives

- Understand + provide context behind blockchain technology
- Give some use cases/industries on blockchain

## Chapter 1:  Context

- ### Why use blockchain? Well there's 3 reasons:

  1. `Transparency`

  1. `Trustless`
  2. `Secure`
     - Does this via cryptographic hashing.

- ### Examples app's:

  - Here are some example applications used in the wild for far:
    - [compound finance website](https://compound.finance/)
      - built on a decentralized application (or `DAPP` for short)
  - DAI is a good example of a `stable coin` - or a coin that is built with stability in mind, as it doesn't fluxuate in prices as drastically. Because no one like's loosing money.
    - [DAI Coin](https://makerdao.com/en/)
  - Argent - a `DAPP` that is also a mobile wallet
    - [Argent Mobile Wallet](https://www.argent.xyz/)
    - Includes integration with UniSwap
  - UniSwap - allows you to trade one coin for another
